# Statistical Learning

---

### What is statistical learning?

The aim is to model the  relationship between the outcome and some set of features features

$$y = f(X) + \epsilon$$

where 

- $y$ is the outcome/dependent/response variable 

- $X$ is a matrix of predictors/features/independent variables 

- $f$ is some fixed but unknown function mapping $X$ to $y$. The "signal" in the data.

- $\epsilon$ is some random error term. The "noise" in the data.

---

### What is statistical learning?

Statistical learning refers to a set of methods/approaches for estimating $f(.)$ 

$$\hat{y} = \hat{f}(X)$$

Where $\hat{f}(X)$ is an approximation of the "true" functional form, $f(X)$, and $\hat{y}$ is the predicted value.

The aim is to find a $\hat{f}(X)$ that minimizes the **_reducible_ error**.

--

$$E(y - \hat{y})^2$$
$$E[f(X) + \epsilon -  \hat{f}(X)]^2$$

$$\underbrace{E[f(X) -\hat{f}(X)]^2}_{\text{Reducible}} + \underbrace{var(\epsilon)}_{\text{Irreducible}}$$

---

### Reducible vs. Irreducible Error

$$\underbrace{E[f(X) -\hat{f}(X)]^2}_{\text{Reducible}} + \underbrace{var(\epsilon)}_{\text{Irreducible}}$$



The **"reducible" error** is the systematic **signal**. We can reduce this error by using different functional forms, better data, or a mixture of those two. 

The **"irreducible" error** is associated with the random **noise** around $y$. 

Statistical learning is concerned with minimizing the reducible error. However, our predictions  will never be perfect given the irreducible error. 

There is a lower bound on how accurate we can be.

---

### Inference vs. Prediction

Two reasons we want to estimate $f(\cdot)$: 

--

- **Inference**

  + Goal is **_interpretation_**
  
      - _Which predictors are associated with the response?_
      - _What is the relationship between the response and the predictors?_
      - _Is the relationship causal?_
      
  + **<font color = "darkred"> Key limitation</font>**: 
  
      - using functional forms that are easy to interpret (e.g. lines) might be far away from the true function form of $f(X)$.
  
---
  
### Inference vs. Prediction

Two reasons we want to estimate $f(\cdot)$: 
  
- **Prediction**

  + Goal is to **_predict_** future values of the outcome, $\hat{y}_{t+1}$
  
  + $\hat{f}(X)$ is treated as a **<font color=#282828>_black box_</font>**
      + model doesn't need to be interpretable as long as it provides an accurate prediction of $y$.
  
  + **<font color = "darkred"> Key limitation</font>**: 
  
      - <u>Interpretation</u>: it is difficult to know which variables are doing the heavy lifting and the exact influence of $x$ on $y$.
      

---

### Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning

- <u>**Supervised Learning**</u> 

  - for each observation of the predictor measurement $x_i$ there is an associated response measurement $y_i$. In essence, there is an _outcome_ we are aiming to accurately predict or understand.
  
  - use regression and classification methods
  
```{r,echo=F,fig.align="center",fig.width=7,fig.height=4}
set.seed(123)
x <- rnorm(150)
y = 1 + 2*x + rnorm(150)
tibble(x,y) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x,y)) +
  geom_point(size=3,color="grey30") +
  geom_smooth(method="lm",se=F,size=2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title = element_text(size=18))
```
  
 
---
  
### Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
  
- <u>**Unsupervised Learning**</u>  

  - we observe a vector of measurements $x_i$ but _no_ associated response $y_i$.
  
  - "unsupervised" because we lack a response variable that can supervise our analysis.
  
```{r,echo=F,fig.align="center",fig.width=7,fig.height=4}
set.seed(123)
n = 50
sigma = matrix(c(1,0,0,1),ncol=2,nrow=2)
x1 <- MASS::mvrnorm(n,c(0,0),Sigma = sigma) %>% as_tibble() %>% mutate(group=1)
x2 <- MASS::mvrnorm(n,c(-3,-3),Sigma = sigma) %>% as_tibble() %>% mutate(group=2)
x3 <- MASS::mvrnorm(n,c(-3,3),Sigma = sigma) %>% as_tibble() %>% mutate(group=3)
bind_rows(x1,x2,x3) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(V1,V2,color=factor(group),pch=factor(group))) +
  geom_point(size=3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title = element_text(size=18))
```

### Regression vs. Classification

_Outcomes_ come in many forms. How the outcome is distributed will determine the methods we use. 

--

- **Quantitative** outcome

  + a continuous/interval-based outcome: e.g. housing price, number of bills passed, stock market prices, etc.
  
  + Regression Methods: linear, penalization, generalized additive models (GAMs) 
  
  + Both parametric and non-parametric ways of approximating $f(\cdot)$


---

### Regression vs. Classification

_Outcomes_ come in many forms. How the outcome is distributed will determine the methods we use. 

- **Quantitative** outcome

- **Qualitative** outcome

  + a discrete outcome
  
      + _Binary_: War/No War; Sick/Not Sick
      
      + _Ordered_: Don't Support, Neutral, Support
      
      + _Categorical_: Cat, Dog, Bus, ... 
      
  + Classification Methods: logistic regression, naive Bayes, support vector machines, neural networks
  
---

### Regression vs. Classification

_Outcomes_ come in many forms. How the outcome is distributed will determine the methods we use. 

- **Quantitative** outcome

- **Qualitative** outcome
 
- Some methods can be used on either outcome type
  - K nearest neighbors
  - tree-based methods (random forest, gradient boosting)

- Every model has specific **tuning parameters** that we can use to optimize performance.

### Under-fitting (Bias)

```{r,echo=F,fig.align="center",fig.width=10,fig.heigh=6}
set.seed(123)
N = 100
x <- rnorm(N)
X <- splines::bs(x,degree=7)
B <- runif(7,-5,5) 
y <- X%*%B + rnorm(N,mean = 0,.2)
D = tibble(x,y = as.numeric(y))


modA = lm(y ~ x,data = D)
D$yhatA = predict(modA,D)

# Plot 
D %>% 
ggplot(aes(x,y)) +
  geom_point(alpha=.7,size=5,color="grey30") +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_line(aes(x,yhatA),color="blue",size=3,alpha=.6) +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title = element_text(size=20),
        axis.text = element_text(size=18))
```

---

### Over-fitting (Variance)

```{r,echo=F,fig.align="center",fig.width=10,fig.heigh=6}
modD = lm(y ~ poly(x,21),data = D)
D$yhatD = predict(modD,D)

D %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x,y)) +
  geom_point(alpha=.7,size=5,color="grey30") +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_line(aes(x,yhatD),color="blue",size=3,alpha=.6) +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title = element_text(size=20),
        axis.text = element_text(size=18))
```

---

### Model Accuracy

- We need to quantify the extent to which the predicted response value for a given observation is close to the true response value for that observation

--

- There are many metrics for model accuracy. Which metric you use depends on:

  + type of learning problem you are trying to solve 
  
  + what you aspect of the model you're aiming to optimize
  
--
  
- In the regression setting, the most common accuracy metric is _mean squared error_ (MSE).

$$MSE = \frac{\sum^N_{i=1} (y_i - \hat{f}(X_i))^2}{N}$$
---


### Model Accuracy

$$MSE = \frac{\sum^N_{i=1} (y_i - \hat{f}(X_i))^2}{N}$$


```{r,echo=F,fig.align="center",fig.width=10,fig.height=6}
D2 = D
D2$pred = predict(lm(y~x,data=D))
ggplot(D2,aes(x,y)) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend=x,x=x,yend=y,y=pred),
               color="steelblue",size=1,alpha=.5) +
  geom_point(size=4,alpha=.5) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm",se=F,color="darkred",size=2,alpha=.6) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title = element_text(size=20),
        axis.text = element_text(size=18))
```


---

### Model Accuracy

```{r,echo=F,fig.align="center",fig.width=12,fig.height=8}
modB = lm(y ~ poly(x,2),data = D)
D$yhatB = predict(modB,D)
modC = lm(y ~ poly(x,5),data = D)
D$yhatC = predict(modC,D)
mse = function(y,yh) { mean((y-yh)^2) }

D %>% 
  gather(mod,yh,-y,-x) %>% 
  mutate(mod = str_remove(mod,"yhat")) %>% 
  group_by(mod) %>% 
  mutate(mse =mean((y-yh)^2),
         mse_txt = str_glue("Model {mod}\nMSE = {round(mse,3)}")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x,y)) +
  geom_point(alpha=.7,size=3,color="grey30") +
  geom_line(aes(x,yh),color="blue",size=2,alpha=.6) +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~mse_txt) +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title = element_text(size=18),
        axis.text = element_text(size=20),
        strip.text = element_text(size=24),
        text = element_text(family="serif"))
```


---

### Training and Test Data

- Utilize accuracy metrics to assess model performance, <u>_but we can always make our models flexible enough to minimize the MSE_</u>. 

--

- Need to see how accurate the model is on **_previously unseen data_**.

- Data is usually hard to come by so we partition the data we _do have_ into **training** and **test** sets. The idea is to hold the test data back and <u>never look at it</u>.

--

- Use the test data to calculate the **out of sample predictive accuracy**. 

- By holding off some data we can reduce the tendency to **overfit** the data.

---

### Model accuracy on New Data 

```{r,echo=F}
# New Data Draw
set.seed(321)
N = 100
x <- rnorm(N)
X <- splines::bs(x,degree=7)
# Use the same betas
y <- X%*%B + rnorm(N,mean = 0,.5)
D2 = tibble(x,y = as.numeric(y))

D2$yhatA = predict(modA,D2)
D2$yhatB = predict(modB,D2)
D2$yhatC = predict(modC,D2)
D2$yhatD = predict(modD,D2)

# Define Sets
D$set = "Training Set"
D2$set = "Test Set"

DD = bind_rows(D,D2)
```

```{r,echo=F,fig.align="center",fig.width=12,fig.height=8}
D2 %>% 
  gather(mod,yh,-y,-x,-set) %>% 
  mutate(mod = str_remove(mod,"yhat")) %>% 
  group_by(mod) %>% 
  mutate(mse =mean((y-yh)^2),
         mse_txt = str_glue("Model {mod}\nMSE = {round(mse,3)}")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x,y)) +
  geom_point(alpha=.7,size=3,color='forestgreen') +
  geom_line(aes(x,yh),color="blue",size=2,alpha=.6) +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~mse_txt,scale="free") +
  # ylim(-5,5) +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title = element_text(size=18),
        axis.text = element_text(size=20),
        strip.text = element_text(size=24),
        text = element_text(family="serif"))
```

### Bias-Variance Tradeoff

.center[<img src = "Figures/bias-variance-tradeoff.png",width=800>]

- **high variance**: new data, new pattern.

- **high bias**: rigid pattern, doesn't reflect the data 


---

### Bias-Variance Tradeoff

.center[<img src = "Figures/bias-variance-tradeoff.png">]

- Reality is a **tradeoff**

  - More variance, less bias
  
  - More bias, less variance

# Cross-Validation

---

### What is cross-validation?

<br>

- As we saw, the training error will always be less than the test error due to over-fitting. We need to see how our model performs on data it wasn't trained on (test error)

- "**Re-sampling**" involves repeatedly drawing samples from a training set and refitting a model of interest on each sample in order to obtain additional information about the fitted model. 

- We can use re-sampling techniques to **generate estimates for the test error**. 

- Let's look at **_three cross-validation approaches_**.


---

### Validation Set Approach

- Involves randomly dividing the data into two comparably sized samples, a training set and a validation/test/hold-out set.

- Model is fit to the training set then used to predict the response in the validation set. 

- The resulting error provides an estimate of the test error rate. 
<br>
.center[
<img src="Figures/validation-set.png">
]

---

### Validation Set Approach

**<font color = "darkred">Drawbacks</font>**

- Highly variable: test error rate is sensitive to the estimates that are in the training and test set. 

- Overestimates the test error: only trained on one sub-sample of the data. Models tend to perform worse when trained on less data. 
<br>
.center[
<img src="Figures/validation-set.png">
]

---

### "Leave-One-Out" Cross-Validation (LOOCV)

- Involves splitting the set of observations into two parts. Rather than creating two subsets of comparable size, a single observation is used for the validation set. 

- Estimate the model on $N-1$ observation, then test on the remaining observation.

- Do this $N$ times and average the test error. 

![:space 2]

.center[
<img src="Figures/LOOCV.gif">
]

---

### "Leave-One-Out" Cross-Validation (LOOCV)

Far less biased than the validation approach. Does not overestimate the test error. No randomness in the training/test split

**<font color = "darkred">Drawbacks</font>**: 

- Computationally expensive: you have to re-estimate the same model N times!

![:space 2]

.center[
<img src="Figures/LOOCV.gif">
]

---


### $K$-Fold Cross-Validation

- Involves randomly dividing the data into $k$ groups (or folds). Model is trained on $k-1$ folds, then test on the remaining fold. 

- Process is repeated $k$ times, each time using a new fold. Offers $k$ estimates of the test error, which we average. 

<br><br>

]

---

### $K$-Fold Cross-Validation

- Less computationally expensive (LOOCV is a special case of $K$-fold where $k = n$) 

- Gives more accurate estimates of the test error rate than LOOCV
