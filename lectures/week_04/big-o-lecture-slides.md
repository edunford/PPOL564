## What is an algorithm?

An **algorithm** is "a generic, step-by-step list of instructions for solving a problem. It is a method for solving any instance of the problem such that given a particular input, the algorithm produces the desired result."

**Example of an algorithm**:
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort

<br>

## What is a program?

A **program** is "an algorithm that has been encoded into some programming language. There may be many programs for the same algorithm, depending on the programmer and the programming language being used."

**Example of a Program**:

- `list.sort()`

## Peanut Butter & Jelly Sandwich Algorithm


Inputs:
- _Peanut Butter_
- _Jelly_,
- _Bread_

Steps:

- Grab two _slices_ of bread from _Bread_,
- Apply 2 tbl of peanut butter to both slices of bread,
- Apply 1 tbl of jelly to one slice of bread,
- Place slice with peanut butter (spread-side) on top of slice with peanut butter and jelly (spread-side)
- Check to that the spreads are in the middle not on the outside of the sandwich; if so, sandwich is ready

## Evaluating Algorithms

- Readability
- Use of the computer's resources
  - How much memory does it use up?
  - How long does it take to run?

### Forget Machine or Coding Language

### Size of the Problem
"When trying to characterize an algorithm‚Äôs efficiency in terms of execution time, independent of any particular program or computer, it is important to **quantify the number of operations or steps that the algorithm will require.**"


<br><br><hr><br><br>

### Exact Number of Operations, Not Important; Most "dominant" part important.

<br>

- #### "...as the problem gets larger, some portion of the function tends to overpower the rest."

<br>

- #### The <u>**order of magnitude function**</u> describes the part of the algorithm that increases the fastest as the value of n increases.

<br>

- #### Order of magnitude is often called <u>**Big-O notation**</u> (for ‚Äúorder‚Äù) and written as ùëÇ(n).

| f(n) |  Name | Notation|
|:----:|:-----:|:--------:|
| 1| Constant| O(1) |
| log(n) | Logarithmic | O(log n) |
| n | Linear | O(n) |
| n log(n) | Log Linear | O(n log n) |
| n^2 | Quadratic | O(n^2) |
| n^3 | Cubic | O(n^3) |
| 2^n | Exponential | O(2^n) |
