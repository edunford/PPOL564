# Instructions

Below I provide simple code for a few functions. As a group, please analyze the run time for the different functions. The questions ask you to consider **time** (and for some **space** complexity) -- that is, how long does the algorithm take to run, and how much space does it take up. I've provided multiple choice answers for each question, choose the correct answer. 

<br><br>

## Question 1 

What is the time, space complexity of following code?

```{python,eval=F}
import random 
# M and N are inputs
a = 0
b = 0
for i in range(N):
  if random.gauss(0,1) > 0:
    a += 1
  else:
    a -= 1
    
for j in range(M):
  if random.gauss(0,1) > 0:
    b += 1
  else:
    b -= 1
```

<br>

A. $O(NM)$ time, $O(1)$ space

B. $O(N + M)$ time, $O(N + M)$ space

C. $O(N + M)$ time, $O(1)$ space

D. $O(NM)$ time, $O(N + M)$ space

## Question 2

What is the time complexity of following code?

```{python,eval=F}
# N is an input
a = 0
for i in range(N):
  for j in range(i,N):
    a = a + i + j
```

<br>

A. $O(N)$

B. $O(N log(N))$

C. $O(N \sqrt N)$

D. $O(N^2)$

## Question 3

What is the time complexity of following code?

```{python,eval=F}
# N is an input
a = 0
i = N
while i > 0:
  a += i
  i = i//2
```

<br>

A. $O(N)$

B. $O(N^2)$

C. $O(\frac{N}{2})$

D. $O(log_2 N)$
